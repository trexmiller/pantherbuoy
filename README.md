<h2>An Open Source Data Logger and Real Time Environmental Monitoring System

The Panther Buoy system is an open source, low power "Internet of Things" datalogger for autonomously and continuously reading data from environmental sensors, saving data to an internal storage drive and sending data to an online database using an embedded cellular modem (LTE Cat4 or NB-IoT such as from Nimbelink or Xbee). The Panther Buoy is configured to read sensors developed by or commonly used by the Miller Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee for environmental monitoring including sensors developed by our user community.  It was developed in response to our long- term interest in monitoring and predicting harmful algal blooms and their associated weather and water quality conditions. The system consists of a mother board, I/O board, batteries, and solar charger board. These are typically mounted in enclosures inside a dry well of a buoy such as the Nexsens CB-150 buoy.
